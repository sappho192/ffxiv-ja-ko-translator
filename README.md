Japaneseâ†’Korean Translator specialized in Final Fantasy XIV

## Description

This project is started to solve the [[issue](https://github.com/sappho192/IronworksTranslator/issues/45)] in IronworksTranslator, which is to provide more accurate translation result in Final Fantasy XIV game chat.

Papago and DeepL can be a great choice in common situation, but not for the text in specific game. So I'm trying to make the alternative to help people who want to get better understand and communication in Japanese game.

## Limitations of this project

Since the main goal of this project is to help Koreans communicate in Japanese games, so I'm not considering other languages. However, I believe you can use the structure of this project to create your own translator for your own language combinations.

## Goal of this project

### 1. Proof of Concept Phase 1

* [ ] A model trained on a small amount of game terms is able to correctly translate the same terms
* [ ] Somewhat translate sentences that contain some game terms

### 2. Proof of Concept Phase 2

* [ ] Properly translate sentences that contain some game terms
* [ ] Somewhat translate sentences that contain most of game terms

### 3. Beta Phase

* [ ] Properly translate sentences that contain most of game terms

### 4. Future Phase

* [ ] Train a model which can interactively help understanding the Japanese game chat (like a ChatGPT or Bing chatbot)
