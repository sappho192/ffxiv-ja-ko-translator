Japaneseâ†’Korean Translator specialized in Final Fantasy XIV

## Description

This project is started to solve the [[issue](https://github.com/sappho192/IronworksTranslator/issues/45)] in IronworksTranslator, which is to provide more accurate translation result in Final Fantasy XIV game chat.

Papago and DeepL can be a great choice in common situation, but not for the text in specific game. So I'm trying to make the alternative to help people who want to get better understand and communication in Japanese game.

## Limitations of this project

Since the main goal of this project is to help Koreans communicate in Japanese games, so I'm not considering other languages. However, I believe you can use the structure of this project to create your own translator for your own language combinations.
