Japaneseâ†’Korean Translator specialized in Final Fantasy XIV

## Description

This project is started to solve the [[issue](https://github.com/sappho192/IronworksTranslator/issues/45)] in IronworksTranslator, which is to provide more accurate translation result in Final Fantasy XIV game chat.

Papago and DeepL can be a great choice in common situation, but not for the text in specific game. So I'm trying to make the alternative to help people who want to get better understand and communication in Japanese game.
